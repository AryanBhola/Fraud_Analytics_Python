# Online Fraud Analytics Python Use Case

**Date**: February 20, 2024

## Overview
Fraud remains a critical issue for financial institutions, leading to billions of dollars in losses annually. As digital transactions increase, so does the need for robust fraud detection systems. In this project, we explore how data analysis can aid in detecting fraudulent activities and help safeguard financial integrity. This use case is designed with the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in mind, focusing on providing actionable insights to mitigate fraud.

## About the Dataset
The Fraud Analytics dataset contains detailed information on transactions, including transaction IDs, dates, types, subtypes, payment service providers (PSP), cities, amounts, and more. It captures various dimensions, such as temporal, financial, geographical, technical, and behavioral aspects of transactions, making it a rich resource for identifying and understanding fraud.

Sample Transaction Table:
| txn_id | dt_txn_comp  | txn_comp_time | txn_type   | txn_subtype                      | initiating_channel_id | txn_status | error_code | payer_psp         | payee_psp            | payee_state   |
|--------|--------------|---------------|------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 1      | 2021-06-22   | 8:40:00 PM    | Fee        | Transaction Fee                  | 6                     | Successful |            | Axis Pay          | Google Pay for Business | Uttar Pradesh |
| 2      | 2023-06-02   | 8:36:00 AM    | Payment    | Peer-to-Peer (P2P)               | 18                    | Successful |            | PhonePe           | PhonePe for Merchants | Karnataka     |

This dataset includes over 50,000 rows and 34 distinct columns. The data types consist mainly of strings, with some numerical and date-time values.

## How to Improve Fraud Detection
To enhance real-time fraud detection and prevention, focus on these key areas:
1. Identify stakeholders, such as the CFO, who will use the fraud insights.
2. Develop an empathy map to understand user challenges and pain points.
3. Identify relevant KPIs, such as fraud loss value, number of incidents, and geospatial distribution.
4. Align objectives to enhance financial security, optimize resources, and minimize risks.
5. Formulate business questions like, “Which regions are most prone to fraud?”

### Example Python Code
Here’s an example of how to visualize fraud incidents over time:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Sample data for visualization
data = {'Month': ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April'],
        'Fraud Incidents': [10, 15, 7, 12]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plot
plt.plot(df['Month'], df['Fraud Incidents'])
plt.title('Fraud Incidents Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Number of Incidents')
plt.show()
```

### Sample Business Questions
1. How have fraud incidents fluctuated over the years?
2. Which types of fraud cause the most financial damage?
3. Are certain regions more prone to fraud than others?

### Key Insights
- **Time-based patterns**: Fraud spikes in July and August suggest increased vigilance is required during these months.
- **Regional risks**: States like Punjab and West Bengal show a high number of fraud incidents, indicating the need for state-specific prevention measures.

## Conclusion
By understanding the CFO's concerns and focusing on key metrics, we can design a fraud detection system that not only meets but exceeds expectations. This system will protect the organization’s financial integrity in an increasingly digital world.
